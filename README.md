# Maze-Game
It is a snake maze game where the snake's length increases while it traverses through the maze. However, the wall of the maze is poisonous and hence cannot be touched by the snake. Snake dies on getting in contact with the maze wall and thus game gets over. The game has got two levels first one is less complicated while the second one is made more interesting with hurdles in its path. If more than three hurdles are encountered the game gets over.
A user friendly interface is created and the game score of each user is recorded using the file system.

It is built using OOPs concept and file system of C++.
There are two versions of the game in two seperate .cpp files.
